27.06.2025 +0.50 = 11.00: add optional parameter to enable in-focus masks limiting with circles around focus points
24.06.2025 +1.00 = 10.50: fix DSCF5508.JPG via drawing circles for in-focus masking only around in-focus points (i.e. extremums from DoG high freqs)
24.06.2025 +0.25 = 9.50: fix DSCF5538.JPG via filtering connected components by DoG in-focus extrema voting (when depth estimation has errors)
22.06.2025 +1.50 = 9.25: find problematic shoe photos (5538, 5527) where depth is not good enough, try Apple's Depth Pro - it is x10 slower and still not good enough
22.06.2025 +0.50 = 7.75: first try to run CLI and import masks into Metashape, support Metashape's Python 3.9 (typing.Optional instead of "Type|None"), optional --debug-dir param
22.06.2025 +0.50 = 7.25: fixing github CI
22.06.2025 +0.75 = 6.75: creating setup.py, github CI, simple smoke tests, CLI application (for directory processing)
22.06.2025 +1.25 = 6.00: automatic downloading for Depth Anything v2 model weights (with caching)
19.06.2025 +1.25 = 4.75: infering depth anything via ONNX (currently only on CPU, without lazy model weight loading)
19.06.2025 +1.50 = 3.50: refactoring with ChatGPT + fixing bug introduced with refactoring (threshold estimation with wrong extremum mask)
15.06.2025 +2.00 = 2.00: initial algorithm prototype with DeepSeek
